## All the Individual Object constraint functions are defined here
from Class_Structures import *
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

### Throughout, the sides of the objects are defined as follows:
# 'back' of the object would be the headboard of a bed, or the back of a chair
# 'front' of the object would be the foot of a bed, or the front of a wardrobe (the side with the doors)
# 'left' would be the left side of the object, when standing behind it
# 'right' would be the right side of the object, when standing behind it
