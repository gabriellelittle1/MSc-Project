style: Certainly! Let's create a coherent and atmospheric Pharaoh's tomb based on the description.

### Walls:
- **Colour**: The walls of the tomb are painted in a warm, sandy beige colour that can mimic the natural stone and sandstone typically found in ancient Egyptian tombs.
- **Material**: The walls are covered with detailed hieroglyphs and vibrant murals depicting scenes of the Pharaoh's life and the gods, framed by carved stone reliefs. There's no wallpaper, as ancient Egyptian tombs were decorated with intricate wall art and carvings.
  
### Windows and Doors:
- **Windows**: Traditional Egyptian tombs rarely had windows due to their purpose. If we include small openings, they would be narrow slits (clerestory windows) high on the walls, framed in dark, aged wood with lattice designs, covered with muslin to soften incoming light. No glass, in keeping with the period authenticity.
- **Doors**: The door to the tomb is a grand stone slab with intricately carved symbols and golden accents. The frame is dark wood, adorned with gold leaf and lapis lazuli inlays.
