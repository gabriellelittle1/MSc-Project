# MSc Project
All the code for my project on using LLMs for scene synthesis.


To run the code, use the following file: "DSL/SceneSynthesis.ipynb". 
You will need to add in your api key. This can be found in the SceneSynthesis notebook (second cell). 
Edit the scene_descriptor in order to generate the desired room. 

The resulting text file will be saved in the file "Result_txt".
